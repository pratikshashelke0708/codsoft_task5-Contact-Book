How a Contact Book is Created in Python (Logic):
Plan Features: Add, view, search, update, delete, exit.
Store Contacts: Use a dictionary (contacts = {}) with name as key and phone as value.

Create Functions:
Add contact → get input and save in dictionary
View contacts → loop and display all
Search contact → check if name exists
Update contact → change phone number if exists
Delete contact → remove contact if exists
Menu Loop: Use while True to show options and call functions based on user input.
Handle Errors: Validate input and handle missing contacts.

Tools / Libraries:
Python – programming language
IDLE / VS Code / PyCharm – for writing and running code
File Handling (optional) – to save contacts permanently
Concepts / Tags Used:
Dictionary – store contacts (name: phone)
Functions – add, view, search, update, delete contacts
Loops (while) – menu-driven program
Conditional Statements (if-else) – check choices and contact existence
Input/Output (input() & print()) – interact with the user
